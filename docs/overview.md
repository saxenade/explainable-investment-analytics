# Explainable Investment Analytics Framework (EIAF) — Overview

EIAF is a lightweight framework designed to standardize explainability outputs for
tabular machine learning models used in investment and credit-risk analytics.

Unlike visualization-focused explainability tools, EIAF emphasizes **audit-ready,
machine-readable artifacts** that can be stored, reviewed, and compared across
model runs.

## Design Goals
- Model-agnostic (scikit-learn first)
- Repeatable and deterministic outputs
- Human-readable reason codes
- Governance- and audit-friendly artifacts

## Target Use Cases
- Credit risk models
- Investment analytics
- Portfolio monitoring
- Model risk management (MRM)
- Regulatory and internal audits
